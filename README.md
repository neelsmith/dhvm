This repositories defines a virtual machine with Vagrant and VirtualBox for working with digital texts.  I'm using it in my F'16 course at Holy Cross, "Digital Reading, Digital Writing". 

The machine runs Elementary OS 0.3 for its operating system.  It is planned to include:

- programming languages: 
    - java 8
    - scala (version?)
- editors:
    - Atom (with scala mode)
    - XmlCopyEditor (for validating XML against RNG schemas)
- a build system: sbt
